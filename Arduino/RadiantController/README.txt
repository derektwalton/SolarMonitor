I've found that this project can be compiled, downloaded, and flashed using the Arduino
IDE, which is good because I am no longer able to get the debugger to work.  I am currently
using v 1.8.19 of the Arduino IDE.

DO NOTE that with the cheap Chinese NANOs which I have it is necessary to keep the serial
monitor OPEN when attempting to download / program.
